# Loan Default Prediciton
In this project, loan default data is analysed and different machine learning models to classify a loan as wheter a loan will be defaulted or not are trained and evaluated.

## General Information
- Project involves performing EDA to derive insight from the loan default data
- Five models - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost and Naive Bayes are  trained and evaluated
- Models are cross validatied to compute mean of perfromance metrice
- Perfromance metrics used are - Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score.
- Parmaeter tuning is used to improve metrics and important features are indentified
 
## Project Structure
Project contains following files:
- credit.csv - File with loan default data
- loan_defalt.ipynb - jupyter notebook file
- report.pdf - PDF file with results of analysis and model evaluations
- requirements.txt - file with infomration of python libraries used
